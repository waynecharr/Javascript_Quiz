## Wayne Charrette JavaScript Quiz

Hopefully this name is original enough. I pulled the answers from the instructional gif we were given. The only thing I didn't include was the ability to clear the high scores since it wasn't required the criteria to do so.

# Version History

- "initial commit" contains basic index, css, and started javascript
- "updated css added classes for buttons" - haven't worked out much of the javascript beyond the timer. updated much of the stylesheets.
- "updated index and customized array, removed timer" - created an array for the javascript for the question prompts. I have what I believe I need for the index.html. I now have a better understanding of how display:none display: block function so that part is figured out. 
- "start quiz function working" the start question function is working. unfortunately the questions choices aren't displaying! Need to figure out why that's happening. 
- "choices are displaying" - small syntax erorr caused the choices to not display properly
- "added the time functionality" - Katie Redford helped me with getting the time sorted out. I think I understand it now. 
- "added the local storage log" - Logs Initials and high score. 
- "added an endQuiz() function when timer hits 0" - added an additional caveat that ends the game when the timer hits 0 
- "added remaining buttons, fixed timer error, added log for high scores" - kind of a big update. added a bunch of function buttons such as submit score, back button, and view high scores. Updated a small amount of css. Added in the scoreArray to log scores and append it to a list. 
- "updated README" - quick changes to the README. Need to add an image folder for images. 
- "CSS changes, added images" - made some changes to the CSS. Added images to the png. 

## Resources 

- Mostly pulled from the activities from last week's module for this assignment. Did find a few helpful answers Stack Overflow, particularly "onclicks" which I had never seen before as well a forEach function.
- Worked with Katie Redford to help with the time functionality 
- Used gif splitter in order to see the questions and the answers.
